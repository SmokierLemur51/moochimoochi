#*#*#*# MAPPING.GO #*#*#*#

	Right now my plan to manage the operational area is to create 
	a graph of the (x,y) coordinates of the area of operation. I think
	this would be easier and result in smaller api calls.

	Basically the user will put in their address, which is sent to the backend
	and if those coordinates are inside the area of operation, an error message
	will not be sent back to the client telling them they are out of range.


	What will I need?

		- Google maps api {
			- I think this will be the best way to grab coordinates
			- I also want to implement a mapping feature to make driving more efficient
		}
		- How to calculate complex shapes on a graph, but not too complex
		- Calculating the estimated cost of the trip and how many miles will be traveled
		- Generate data for the user to better understand the business they run


		** Structs & Struct-Methods Required **

			- Address
				- Generate x,y
				- Have different grades of delivery fees to calculate. Within 15 miles
					it could be cheaper than outside of 45 miles

			- OperatonalGrid
				- Compare coordinates function

			- Approved order
				- Generate delivery charge
